# Shaders - Portals
A showcase of shader effects to replicate portals in videogames.

## Overview

This project is all about portals. Stepping outside of pure shader work and into the world of C# scripting, this series goes a lot more in-depth with the link between scripting and shaders than my previous work, highlighting the importance of making both sides work together.

This project goes in-depth with: **cubemaps**, **stencil buffers**, **oblique near-plane projection**, **linear algebra and local/world space transformations**, **screenspace texture sampling**, **raycasting**, **rigidbodies and collision**.

### Shaders Included

This project includes shaders for:
- A *Spyro*-style portal effect including a cubemap-based rendering of the world on the other side of the portal;
- A *Manifold Garden*-style placeable portal that renders a non-recursive view through the other portal in realtime using the stencil buffer, an oblique projection matrix and smart camera placement;
- A *Portal*-style portal that builds on the previous version, adding recursion and using screenspace texture sampling instead of the stencil buffer.

## Software

This project was created using Unity 2019.2.0f1. It should work on other versions of Unity, although the project may need upgrading or downgrading.

## Authors
This project, and the corresponding tutorial series, were written by [Daniel Ilett](https://danielilett.com/).
